Built a ticket generator with the basic stack with form validation. My design respects the original layout with some minuses: the background images might seem a bit different from the original layout(some of them). 
I did some research about some input type file validation, handling the FileList object, removing and changing states for uploaded files. I also did some research about local storage, encoding the url to ensure data 
handling. The project meets all specified requirements.
